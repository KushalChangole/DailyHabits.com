            <p>
                I wish to thank the whole team for this amazing app that has all the features that one could ask for.
                I cannot explain the huge number of apps that I have tried just to track my habits and be a bit more productive with what I do as a student.
                However, almost all the apps were either super expensive to try, offered minimum features, or just made everything so complicated. However, with Daily Habits, I can track everything down in one place and can actually see my progress throughout the month just by a glance.

                    Just want to say that I love what you guys built.
                    I think it's the perfect habit building app in a market totally oversaturated with them it stands out to me.

                    Your website is just what I was looking for, and using it has helped me a lot, both in tracking old habits and building new ones.
                    It's wonderfully easy to use, customise and navigate, and I love that you can adjust the stacking of the habits, and archive them once you're ready to stop tracking them.
                    Thank you for building a functional, clean habit tracker.
